pyMAX
=====


**Archived** -- This project is no longer maintained.


This is an _unofficial_ desktop app for "MAX" a child-care mobile app created by Child Care Center Software. The mobile app was not as intuitive as I had like, so I made a desktop app that displayed the information in a way I preferred.

We no longer use MAX at all, so this project is considered abandoned.


Installation
------------

On linux/OS X:

- install python3
- install gtk3
- install pygobject
- install all the required packages in `requirements.txt`.
- if you are using a virtual environment, you can use pygobject in it with `vext.gi`, which is in `linux.requirements.txt`
